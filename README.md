# dashboard_streamlit

<h1>Project Background</h1>
<p>JomTrace is an innovative project which focuses on automated pandemic contact tracing using the Bluetooth technology and network analysis to predict and monitor the pandemic. Our main motive is to break the chain of spread by sending automated notifications to users who might be exposed to Covid-19. This project is aimed to keep our USM community safe in this pandemic. <p>


<h3> Health dashboard is created to analyse by the health authority. <h3>
  
<h1> One Mode Analysis </h1>
 
<h5> One Mode Graph <h5>
<img src= "https://github.com/jom-trace/dashboard_streamlit/blob/main/Images/One%20Mode%20Graph.png" width = "500px">
  
<p> The one mode analysis will create one-mode graph where it shows edges between nodes. From there, we can analyse how the people are connected visually. <p>
  <br>

<h5> Apriori Analysis <h5>

 <p>  The apriori algorithm will show the support of the edges formed and the support will be higher for the edge that frequently in contact. <p>
  <br>

<h5> K-Means Clustering <h5>
 <img src= "https://github.com/jom-trace/dashboard_streamlit/blob/main/Images/K-Means%20Clustering.png" width = "500px">
  
 <p> We used K-Means algorithm to find the total group of all the positive nodes. We set the K range as dynamic in K-Means so the health authority can be able to adjust the K to visualise the nodes in different groups. <p>

  <h1> Two Mode Analysis </h1>
 
<h5> Two Mode Graph <h5>
<img src= "https://github.com/jom-trace/dashboard_streamlit/blob/main/Images/Capture.PNG" width = "500px">
  
<p> The two mode analysis will create two-mode graph where it shows edges between nodes. From there, we can analyse how the people are connected visually. It will also show connection between people and location visited as well. <p>
  <br>

<h5> Searching Close Contact People Function <h5>
 <img src= "https://github.com/jom-trace/dashboard_streamlit/blob/main/Images/Capture1.PNG" width = "500px">
  
 <p>  Using this feature user can find a particular person's close contacts and also warn them. <p>
  <br>

<h5> Searching for Number of People Visited a Place. <h5>
 <img src= "https://github.com/jom-trace/dashboard_streamlit/blob/main/Images/Capture2.PNG" width = "500px">
  
 <p> Using this feature user will be able to search the number of people visited a particular location. <p>
  
   <br>

<h5> Betwenness Centrality <h5>
 <img src= "https://github.com/jom-trace/dashboard_streamlit/blob/main/Images/Capture3.PNG" width = "500px">
  
 <p> Shows the betwenness centrality of each nodes from the highest to lowest.<p>
  
   <br>

<h5> Distribution of Popularity and Strength <h5>
 <img src= "https://github.com/jom-trace/dashboard_streamlit/blob/main/Images/Capture4.PNG" width = "500px">
  
 <p> Shows the Distribution of Popularity and Strength.<p>
