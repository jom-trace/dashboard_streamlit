<h>Project Background</h>
JomTrace is an innovative project which focuses on automated pandemic contact tracing using the Bluetooth technology and network analysis to predict and monitor the pandemic. Our main motive is to break the chain of spread by sending automated notifications to users who might be exposed to Covid-19. This project is aimed to keep our USM community safe in this pandemic.
